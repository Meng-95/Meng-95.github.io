High-performance coherent modulators with high data rates, wide bandwidth, small footprint, and low power operation are highly desired. Toward this end, we propose a folded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) dual-polarization in-phase quadrature modulator featuring a low half-wave voltage of 1 V and a compact footprint of 4 × 8 mm2. To suppress RF wavefront distortion and optimize high-frequency electro-optic performance, we utilize air-bridge structures in the U-turns of the traveling-wave electrodes. As a demonstration of the long-haul transmission capacities with our device, we present driverless 703 Gb/s/λ line-rate transmissions, with a subcarrier modulation scheme, over a 1120 km single-mode fiber link. Here, for the first time, to our knowledge, our device allows for attojoule-per-bit level electrical energy consumption over transmission distances above 1000 km. The device opens opportunities for much lower-cost and capacity-intensive coherent systems that consume ultra-low power, support high data rate, and work in small spaces. {style=\"text-align: justify;\"}","tags":["Coherent transmission","Electrooptic modulator","Electrooptic modulator"],"title":"Attojoule/bit folded thin film lithium niobate coherent modulators using air-bridge structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Almonacil","Haik Mardoyan","Filipe Jorge","Fabio Pittalà","Xu, Mengyue","Benjamin Krueger","Fabrice Blache","Bernadette Duval","Lifeng Chen","Yangjie Yan","Xiaoyan Ye","Amirhossein Ghazisaeidi","Sina Rimpf","Yuntao Zhu","Jingyi Wang","Michel Goix","Ziyang Hu","Margaux Duthoit","Markus Gruen","Xinlun Cai","Jeremie Renaudier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685057670,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685057670,"objectID":"cd547242286d7ccd47728b90ed7ac3c7","permalink":"https://meng-95.github.io/publication/260-gbaud-single-wavelength-coherent-transmission-over-100-km-ssmf-based-on-novel-arbitrary-waveform-generator-and-thin-film-niobate-i-q-modulator/","publishdate":"2023-05-25T23:34:30.901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/260-gbaud-single-wavelength-coherent-transmission-over-100-km-ssmf-based-on-novel-arbitrary-waveform-generator-and-thin-film-niobate-i-q-modulator/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we demonstrate up to 260-GBaud single-wavelength coherent transmission by employing an optical transmitter based on two wide-bandwidth devices: a novel 260-GS/s arbitrary waveform generator with a 10-dB bandwidth of 90-GHz and a thin-film Lithium Niobate I/Q modulator with a 3-dB bandwidth of 110-GHz.

The presented device exhibits an insertion loss of 2.5 dB, voltage–length product of 2.2 V cm in single-drive push–pull operation, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of at least 70 GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit s−1. The high-performance modulator is realized by seamless integration of a high-contrast waveguide based on lithium niobate—a popular modulator material—with compact, low-loss silicon circuitry. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the combination of ‘best-in-breed’ active and passive components, opening up new avenues for future high-speed, energy-efficient and cost-effective optical communication networks.\n{style=\"text-align: justify;\"}","tags":["Heterogenous integration","Silicon photonics","Electrooptic modulator","Optical communications"],"title":"High-performance hybrid silicon and lithium niobate Mach–Zehnder modulators for 100 Gbit s-1 and beyond","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xu, Mengyue","Wenjun Chen","Mingbo He","Xueqin Wen","Ziliang Ruan","Jian Xu","Lifeng Chen","Liu Liu","Siyuan Yu","Xinlun Cai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549853760,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549853760,"objectID":"aea4cda01d600255279d8da07b81ed0b","permalink":"https://meng-95.github.io/publication/michelson-interferometer-modulator-based-on-hybrid-silicon-and-lithium-niobate-platform/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T02:56:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/michelson-interferometer-modulator-based-on-hybrid-silicon-and-lithium-niobate-platform/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose and demonstrate a hybrid silicon and lithium niobate Michelson interferometer modulator (MIM) with a reduced half-wave voltage-length product compared to a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The modulator is based on seamless integration of a high-contrast waveguide based on lithium niobate—a widely used modulator material—with compact, low-loss silicon circuitry. The present device demonstrates a half-wave voltage-length product as low as 1.2 V cm and a low insertion loss of 3.3 dB. The 3 dB electro-optic bandwidth is approximately 17.5 GHz. The high-speed modulations are demonstrated at 32 Gbit/s and 40 Gbit/s with the extinction ratio of 8 dB and 6.6 dB, respectively. The present device avoids absorption loss and nonlinearity in conventional silicon modulators and demonstrates the lowest half-wave voltage-length product in lithium niobate modulators. The hybrid MIM demonstrates high-speed data modulation showing potential in future optical interconnects.\n{style=\"text-align: justify;\"}","tags":["Heterogenous integration","Electrooptic modulator","Optical communications","Silicon photonics"],"title":"Michelson interferometer modulator based on hybrid silicon and lithium niobate platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xu, Mengyue"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
