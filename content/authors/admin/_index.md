Mengyue Xu is a Postdoctoral Researcher at OxideMEMS Lab, Purdue University advised by Prof. Sunil Bhave. In 2022, Mengyue received a Ph.D. degree in Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics from the State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University, China under the supervision of Prof. Xinlun Cai. Mengyue's Ph.D. research focus on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics, heterogeneous Si/TFLN photonics and their applications in optical communication systems. Her future research interest is quantum spin control of color centers. She has published more than 19 journal papers, has given two invited talks at major international conferences, and currently holds two China patents. Mengyue is a recipient of the 2022 Tingye Li Memorial Scholarship, China’s Top Ten Advances in Optics in 2019 and 2022, National Scholarship from the Ministry of education of China in 2021, Person of the Year of 2021 at Sun Yat-sen University and OFC top-scored paper in 2022.
